 <p>Jesus Herrera</p>Well, I may not be the best person out there in the world but I could say that since I was small I DREAMED BIG and have always and will always. First, A dream that many people tell me that i will never accomplish is becoming one of the biggest idols out there and having othres look up to me for the things I will do for this world to become better. MY second Dream may not be a dream to many people have but, is to build a school...I know it may sound impossible but, I always dreamed of buildimg an amazing school that will become one of the will know school in the world. My third dream... Will it may sound impossible but, is to build places were homless ,immigrant families and poor families to go to were they can recieve help and volunteers can help teach them amd help them get back on thier feet until they are ready to go back to the real world .
